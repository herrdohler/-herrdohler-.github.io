# Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you will find projects that reflect my journey as an education professional, linguistics researcher, and technology enthusiast. This space is dedicated to showcasing my technical and academic skills and my progress in developing technological competencies for applications in linguistics and related fields.

## About Me
I am a professional with a strong background in linguistics and education. I am deeply interested in integrating technology into the study and application of language. My goal is to leverage my technical skills to solve complex linguistic problems, whether in academic research or developing innovative solutions within leading technology companies (BigTechs).

## Portfolio Purpose
This portfolio was created to document and share projects developed through courses and self-driven initiatives focused on:
- Linguistic data analysis.
- Data modeling and database structures.
- Software development and automation applied to linguistics.
- Machine translation and natural language processing (NLP).

## Repository Structure
- **Data Modeling**: Projects on designing relational databases and structures to support linguistic analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Scripts and projects aimed at extracting, manipulating, and visualizing linguistic data.
- **Software Development**: Projects focused on automation and tool integration within linguistics.
- **Courses and Certifications**: Examples of hands-on activities completed during courses, with a focus on technology and applied linguistics.

## Next Steps
I continuously expand this portfolio as I complete new projects and explore emerging technologies. Please follow my progress or contact me to discuss ideas and collaborations.
